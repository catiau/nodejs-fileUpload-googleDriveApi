# Upload your local files to `Google Drive` using `Node.js`

First of all, wouldn't it be much easier to just upload any file directly to Google Drive itself? Yes!

However, when this upload action is constant, it makes sense to have a script that automates this task. That's why I created this script that accomplishes this, and I hope it can help you automate your tasks, or even build other scripts that can facilitate other tasks.

To perform this script, you will need of a file `credentials.json` to use the API. These credentials you can get by following the steps of the documentation below.
